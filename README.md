# Bard Battle, a group project to make a two player game made with Unity.

The game is a music based game where the players will be placed in a tavern with multiple tables. Each player will go to table(s) and play a rhythm based mini game. The more accurate the player is with the rhythm game, the player gets more "Merit". The player that reaches 100 "Merit" fastest wins the game.
